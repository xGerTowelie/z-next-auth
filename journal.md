# stuff i learned on the way
- nextjs middleware
- add a client component inside a server managed context provider
- using different env files with "dotenv cli"
- improving in git commit messages
- functional peogramming: object destructuring from setup function with config parameter (js objects can be async functions)
- shared implementation apis (js library export a function that gets called like outsourcing implementation. e.g. GET and POST habdler in spi route as catch all segments)
